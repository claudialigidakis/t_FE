# Tellie Interview Project Starter Kit

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

We require you have node v10+ installed locally, if you are using this project.

```bash
$ node -v
v12.18.3
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` or `yarn`

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the front-end app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server` or `yarn server`

Runs the backend server ([src/server.js](src/server.js)) at http://localhost:8080.

To verify it is running, in a different shell, you can do:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/health
OK
```

### Starter Kit Functional

When the frontend is successfully able to talk to the backend, you should see:
